My Grocery Buddy is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to help users manage their grocery lists digitally instead of relying on traditional paper lists that can get lost or torn. The app allows users to register and log in securely, with all credentials stored in MongoDB using password hashing. Once logged in, users can add new grocery items, edit them, delete them, mark items as completed after buying, and clear all items if needed. Items are grouped by category, and a search bar allows users to find items by name or category. The app runs locally using npm install to set up dependencies and npm start to launch the server. My Grocery Buddy was developed by Twesige Pream Queen, Avuki Blessing, and Nisiima Praise.
